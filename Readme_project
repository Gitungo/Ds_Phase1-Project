Aviation Safety Risk Analysis

## 1. Business Understanding

### **Business Context**
The company is launching a new **Aviation Division** aimed at expanding operations through the acquisition and management of aircraft.  
To ensure that investments are both safe and cost-effective, leadership seeks to leverage **data-driven safety insights** derived from historical aircraft accident and fatality data.

### **Business Problem**
Aircraft procurement and operational decisions involve significant **financial, regulatory, and safety risks**. Without clear insight into historical accident trends, the company risks investing in aircraft models or operational types that have poor safety records, leading to:
- Increased likelihood of operational incidents  
- Higher maintenance and insurance costs  
- Potential reputational damage  

The central business challenge is to **identify aircraft types, makes, and operational categories with historically lower accident and fatality risks**, allowing for evidence-based purchasing and safety management.

### **Business Objectives**
The primary goals of this project are to:
1. Analyze historical aviation accident data by aircraft make, model, and flight purpose.  
2. Identify high-risk and low-risk aircraft categories based on accident frequency and fatality severity.  
3. Provide actionable insights to support safe and efficient procurement and operational planning.  
4. Build a foundation for future **risk-based decision-making** by normalizing accident data against exposure metrics (e.g., flight hours or fleet size).

### **Intended Outcome**
This project aims to produce a comprehensive safety risk profile for various aircraft types and manufacturers, enabling:
- Smarter, safer investment in aircraft procurement  
- Data-supported operational and insurance planning  
- Improved safety management and regulatory compliance  

## 2. Data Understanding

### **Data Source**
The dataset consists of **historical aircraft accident records**, containing details such as:
- Aircraft make and model  
- Number of engines and engine type  
- Weather conditions at the time of the accident  
- Accident severity (fatalities, damage level, etc.)  
- Flight purpose (personal, commercial, instructional, etc.)  
- Location and date of occurrence  

The data is sourced from publicly available aviation safety databases.

### **Data Quality Overview**
- **Missing Values:** Some fields, such as weather data or aircraft configuration, may contain null or incomplete entries.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Inconsistent manufacturer names and categorical encodings were standardized.  
- **Time Frame:** Covers multiple years to ensure sufficient representation of various aircraft makes and conditions.

## 3. Data Preparation

Key steps performed during data preparation include:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removal of duplicates, correction of typographical errors in aircraft make/model names, and handling of missing data.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new variables such as accident severity categories and weather condition groupings.  
3. **Data Transformation:** Normalization and aggregation of relevant attributes for statistical comparison.  
4. **Filtering:** Focus on fixed-wing, single- and multi-engine aircraft for analytical consistency.  

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory analysis focused on identifying patterns and relationships, including:
- Accident distribution by aircraft make and model  
- Impact of number of engines on accident frequency  
- Weather condition influence on accident severity  
- Comparison of accidents under visual vs. instrument meteorological conditions  
- Identification of aircraft makes with consistently lower accident rates  

Visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to support interpretation.

## 5. Findings & Insights

Key insights from the analysis include:
- **Cessna aircraft** show a higher frequency of accidents, possibly linked to mass production and the availability of counterfeit parts.  
- **Schweizer**, **Maule**, **Stinson**, and **North American** aircraft demonstrate lower accident rates but are less available and may have higher acquisition costs.  
- **Multi-engine aircraft** experience fewer accidents than single-engine models under both favorable and adverse weather conditions, highlighting the role of engine redundancy in safety.  
- Accidents occurring under **good visibility** conditions tend to result in less severe damage compared to those in poor weather requiring instrument flight.  

These insights support a strategy focused on acquiring **multi-engine, low-risk makes** and prioritizing operations in favorable meteorological conditions.

## 6. Conclusion

The analysis concludes that:
- **Engine configuration** is a stronger predictor of accident likelihood than weather conditions.  
- **Aircraft make and model selection** significantly influences operational safety outcomes.  
- **Environmental and visibility conditions** impact accident severity but are secondary to aircraft design and redundancy factors.  

Overall, a **data-driven procurement approach** can substantially improve operational safety, reduce long-term maintenance costs, and strengthen the companyâ€™s aviation safety reputation.

## 7. Recommendations

1. **Prioritize multi-engine aircraft** for acquisition and operations.  
2. **Avoid makes with high historical accident rates** (e.g., Cessna) unless recent safety improvements are verified.  
3. **Develop a continuous safety monitoring system** leveraging real-time data for future decision support.  
4. **Establish partnerships** with manufacturers with strong safety track records and verified parts supply chains.


## 8. Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards  
- **Excel / CSV** for initial data inspection  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration  

## 9. Future Work

Future development will include:
- Building an **interactive Aviation Safety Dashboard** reflective of findings
